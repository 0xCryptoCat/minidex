When the contract is closed-source, other risk items will return null.\n-Proxy Contract\tis_proxy\tReturns \"1\" if the contract is a proxy contract, \"0\" if the contract is not a proxy contract.\tThis value will not be returned if the proxy status of the contract is unknown.\n-(1) Will not be returned if \"is_open_source\" is 0.\n-(2) Most proxy contracts are accompanied by implementation contracts which are modifiable, potentially containing significant risk. When the contract is a proxy, other risk items may not be returned.\n-Mint Function\tis_mintable\tReturns \"1\" if the contract has the ability to mint tokens, \"0\" if the contract does not have the ability to mint tokens.\tThis value will not be returned if the minting ability of the contract is unknown.\n-(1) Will not be returned if \"is_open_source\" is 0.\n-(2) May not be returned if \"is_proxy\" is 1.\n-(3) Mint functions can trigger a massive sell-off, causing the coin price to plummet. It is an extremely risky function for a contract to have.\n-(4) This function generally relies on ownership. When the contract does not have an owner (or if the owner is a black hole address) and the owner cannot be retrieved, this function will most likely be disabled.\n-Owner Address\towner_address\tThis contract's owner address. No value will be returned if the owner address is unknown. An empty string will be returned if the contract has no owner.\t(1) Will not be returned if \"is_open_source\" is 0.\n-(2) May not be returned if \"is_proxy\" is 1.\n-(3) Ownership is usually used to adjust the parameters and status of the contract, such as minting, modification of slippage, suspension of trading, setting blacklist, etc. When the contract's owner cannot be retrieved, is a black hole address, or does not have an owner, ownership-related functionality will most likely be disabled.\n-Take Back Ownership\tcan_take_back_ownership\tReturns \"1\" if ownership can be reclaimed; \"0\" if it cannot. (No return if data is unknown.)\t(1) Will not be returned if \"is_open_source\" is 0.\n-(2) May not be returned if \"is_proxy\" is 1.\n-(3) Ownership is usually used to adjust the parameters and status of the contract, such as minting, modification of slippage, suspension of trading, setting blacklist, etc. When the contract's owner cannot be retrieved, is a black hole address, or does not have an owner, ownership-related functionality will most likely be disabled. These risky functions may be able to be reactivated if ownership is reclaimed.\n-Owner Can Change Balance\towner_change_balance\tReturns \"1\" if the contract owner can change token holder balances; \"0\" if it cannot. (No return if data is unknown.)\t(1) Will not be returned if \"is_open_source\" is 0.\n-(2) May not be returned if \"is_proxy\" is 1.\n-(3) Tokens with this feature allow the owner to modify anyone's balance, resulting in a holder's asset being changed (for example, set to 0) or a massive minting and sell-off.\n-(4) This function generally relies on ownership. When the contract's owner cannot be retrieved, is a black hole address, or does not have an owner, ownership-related functionality will most likely be disabled.\n-With Hidden Owner\thidden_owner\tReturns \"1\" if the contract has hidden owners; \"0\" if it does not.\tWill not be returned if hidden ownership status is unknown.\n-(1) Will not be returned if \"is_open_source\" is 0.\n-(2) May not be returned if \"is_proxy\" is 1.\n-(3) Hidden ownership is used by developers to maintain ownership ability even after abandoning ownership, and is often an indicator of malicious intent. When a hidden owner exists, it is safe to assume that ownership has not been abandoned.\n-Self-Destruct\tselfdestruct\tReturns \"1\" if the contract can self-destruct; \"0\" if it cannot.\tWill not be returned if self-destruct data is unknown.\n-(1) Will not be returned if \"is_open_source\" is 0.\n-(2) When the self-destruct function is triggered, the contract will be destroyed, all of its functions will be unavailable, and all related assets will be erased.\n-With External Call\texternal_call\tReturns \"1\" if the contract can call functions in other contracts during the execution of primary methods; \"0\" if it does not.\tWill not be returned if external call capability is unknown.\n-(1) Will not be returned if \"is_open_source\" is 0.\n-(2) External calls cause the implementation of this contract to be dependent on other external contracts which may or may not be risky.\n-Gas Abuse\tgas_abuse\tReturns \"1\" if the contract is using user's gas fee to mint other assets. (No return means no evidence of gas abuse.)\tAny interaction with such addresses may result in loss of property.\n-Response Details – Trading Security\n-Security Item\tParameter\tDescription\tNotice\n-Is in DEX\tis_in_dex\tReturns \"1\" if the token can be traded in a decentralized exchange; \"0\" if not.\tOnly returns \"1\" if the token has a liquidity pair with mainstream coins/tokens.\n-Buy Tax\tbuy_tax\tReturns the buy tax of the token on a scale from 0 to 1. An empty string (\"\") means the tax is unknown.\t(1) Not returned if is_in_dex = 0.\n-(2) When buying a token, a buy tax will cause the actual token value received to be less than the amount paid. An excessive buy tax may lead to heavy losses.\n-(3) A buy_tax of \"1\" (100% buy tax) means all purchase funds go towards the tax (the token effectively cannot be purchased).\n-(4) A token's anti-bot mechanism may set cannot_buy = 1, which will cause buy_tax to also return \"1\".\n-(5) Some tokens are designed not to be sold, indicated by cannot_buy = 1, which will cause buy_tax to also return \"1\".\n-Sell Tax\tsell_tax\tThe tax when selling the token. An empty string (\"\") means unknown.\t(1) Not returned if is_in_dex = 0.\n-(2) Sell tax causes the actual value received when selling to be less than expected, and too high a sell tax may lead to large losses.\n-(3) sell_tax = \"1\" means sell tax is 100% or the token cannot be sold.\n-(4) Sometimes a token's trading cool-down mechanism (trading_cooldown = 1) can cause sell_tax to return \"1\".\n-Transfer Tax\ttransfer_tax\tThe tax when transferring the token between non-DEX addresses. An empty string or no return means unknown.\t(1) Not returned if is_in_dex = 0.\n-(2) Transfer tax causes the actual value received when transferring to be less than expected; too high a transfer tax may lead to large losses.\n-(3) transfer_tax = \"1\" means transfer tax is 100% or the token cannot be transferred.\n-(4) Sometimes a token's trading cool-down mechanism (trading_cooldown = 1) can cause transfer_tax to return \"1\".\n-Cannot be bought\tcannot_buy\tDescribes whether the token can be bought. \"1\" means it cannot be bought; \"0\" means it can be; no return means unknown.\t(1) Generally, cannot_buy = \"1\" is found in reward tokens (issued as rewards and cannot be bought directly by users).\n-(2) Sometimes a token's anti-bot mechanism can block our sandbox system, causing buy_tax to show \"1\".\n-(3) When cannot_buy = \"1\", our sandbox system might be blocked, causing buy_tax = \"1\" and sell_tax = \"1`.\n-Cannot Sell All\tcannot_sell_all\tDescribes whether the contract has a function restricting token holders from selling all their tokens. \"1\" means true; \"0\" means false; no return means unknown.\t(1) Not returned if is_in_dex = 0.\n-(2) This feature means that you will not be able to sell all your tokens in a single sale; you may need to leave a certain percentage (e.g. 10%) or a fixed number of tokens (e.g. 10 tokens).\n-(3) When buy_tax = \"1\", this field will not be returned.\n-Modifiable Tax\tslippage_modifiable\tDescribes whether the trading tax can be modified by the token contract. \"1\" means true; \"0\" means false; no return means unknown.\t(1) Not returned if is_open_source = 0.\n-(2) Sometimes, if is_proxy = 1, there will be no return.\n-(3) If the tax is modifiable, the contract owner can modify the buy or sell tax. This may cause losses, especially since some contracts have unlimited modifiable tax rates which can make the token untradeable.\n-(4) This function generally relies on ownership. If the contract has no owner (or the owner is a black hole address) and the owner cannot be retrieved, this function will likely be disabled.\n-Honeypot\tis_honeypot\tDescribes whether the token is a honeypot. \"Honeypot\" means the token may not be sellable due to the contract's functions or malicious code. \"1\" means true; \"0\" means false; no return means unknown.\t(1) Not returned if is_open_source = 0.\n-(2) Sometimes, if is_proxy = 1, there will be no return.\n-(3) High risk, definitely a scam token.\n-Pausable Transfer\ttransfer_pausable\tDescribes whether trading can be paused by the token contract. \"1\" means true; \"0\" means false; no return means unknown.\t(1) Not returned if is_open_source = 0.\n-(2) Sometimes, if is_proxy = 1, there will be no return.\n-(3) This feature means the contract owner can suspend trading at any time, after which no one will be able to sell (except those with special authority).\n-(4) This function generally relies on ownership. If the contract has no owner (or the owner is a black hole address) and the owner cannot be retrieved, this function will likely be disabled.\n-Blacklist\tis_blacklisted\tDescribes whether a blacklist function is included in the contract. If there is a blacklist, some addresses may not be able to trade normally. \"1\" means true; \"0\" means false; no return means unknown.\t(1) Not returned if is_open_source = 0.\n-(2) Sometimes, if is_proxy = 1, there will be no return.\n-(3) The contract owner may add any address to the blacklist, and addresses on the blacklist will not be able to trade. Abuse of the blacklist function will lead to great risks.\n-(4) If the contract has no owner (or the owner is a black hole address), the blacklist cannot be updated.

When the contract is closed-source, other risk items will return null. |\n+| Proxy Contract | is_proxy | Returns \"1\" if the contract is a proxy contract, \"0\" if the contract is not a proxy contract. | This value will not be returned if the proxy status of the contract is unknown.&lt;br&gt;(1) Will not be returned if \"is_open_source\" is 0.&lt;br&gt;(2) Most proxy contracts are accompanied by implementation contracts which are modifiable, potentially containing significant risk. When the contract is a proxy, other risk items may not be returned. |\n+| Mint Function | is_mintable | Returns \"1\" if the contract has the ability to mint tokens, \"0\" if the contract does not have the ability to mint tokens. | This value will not be returned if the minting ability of the contract is unknown.&lt;br&gt;(1) Will not be returned if \"is_open_source\" is 0.&lt;br&gt;(2) May not be returned if \"is_proxy\" is 1.&lt;br&gt;(3) Mint functions can trigger a massive sell-off, causing the coin price to plummet. It is an extremely risky function for a contract to have.&lt;br&gt;(4) This function generally relies on ownership. When the contract does not have an owner (or if the owner is a black hole address) and the owner cannot be retrieved, this function will most likely be disabled. |\n+| Owner Address | owner_address | This contract's owner address. No value will be returned if the owner address is unknown. An empty string will be returned if the contract has no owner. | (1) Will not be returned if \"is_open_source\" is 0.&lt;br&gt;(2) May not be returned if \"is_proxy\" is 1.&lt;br&gt;(3) Ownership is usually used to adjust the parameters and status of the contract, such as minting, modification of slippage, suspension of trading, setting blacklist, etc. When the contract's owner cannot be retrieved, is a black hole address, or does not have an owner, ownership-related functionality will most likely be disabled. |\n+| Take Back Ownership | can_take_back_ownership | Returns \"1\" if ownership can be reclaimed; \"0\" if it cannot. (No return if data is unknown.) | (1) Will not be returned if \"is_open_source\" is 0.&lt;br&gt;(2) May not be returned if \"is_proxy\" is 1.&lt;br&gt;(3) Ownership is usually used to adjust the parameters and status of the contract, such as minting, modification of slippage, suspension of trading, setting blacklist, etc. When the contract's owner cannot be retrieved, is a black hole address, or does not have an owner, ownership-related functionality will most likely be disabled. These risky functions may be able to be reactivated if ownership is reclaimed. |\n+| Owner Can Change Balance | owner_change_balance | Returns \"1\" if the contract owner can change token holder balances; \"0\" if it cannot. (No return if data is unknown.) | (1) Will not be returned if \"is_open_source\" is 0.&lt;br&gt;(2) May not be returned if \"is_proxy\" is 1.&lt;br&gt;(3) Tokens with this feature allow the owner to modify anyone's balance, resulting in a holder's asset being changed (for example, set to 0) or a massive minting and sell-off.&lt;br&gt;(4) This function generally relies on ownership. When the contract's owner cannot be retrieved, is a black hole address, or does not have an owner, ownership-related functionality will most likely be disabled. |\n+| With Hidden Owner | hidden_owner | Returns \"1\" if the contract has hidden owners; \"0\" if it does not. | Will not be returned if hidden ownership status is unknown.&lt;br&gt;(1) Will not be returned if \"is_open_source\" is 0.&lt;br&gt;(2) May not be returned if \"is_proxy\" is 1.&lt;br&gt;(3) Hidden ownership is used by developers to maintain ownership ability even after abandoning ownership, and is often an indicator of malicious intent. When a hidden owner exists, it is safe to assume that ownership has not been abandoned. |\n+| Self-Destruct | selfdestruct | Returns \"1\" if the contract can self-destruct; \"0\" if it cannot. | Will not be returned if self-destruct data is unknown.&lt;br&gt;(1) Will not be returned if \"is_open_source\" is 0.&lt;br&gt;(2) When the self-destruct function is triggered, the contract will be destroyed, all of its functions will be unavailable, and all related assets will be erased. |\n+| With External Call | external_call | Returns \"1\" if the contract can call functions in other contracts during the execution of primary methods; \"0\" if it does not. | Will not be returned if external call capability is unknown.&lt;br&gt;(1) Will not be returned if \"is_open_source\" is 0.&lt;br&gt;(2) External calls cause the implementation of this contract to be dependent on other external contracts which may or may not be risky. |\n+| Gas Abuse | gas_abuse | Returns \"1\" if the contract is using user's gas fee to mint other assets. (No return means no evidence of gas abuse.) | Any interaction with such addresses may result in loss of property. |\n \n-Response Details\n-Security Item\tParameter\tDescription\tNotice\n-Data Source\tdata_source\tThe data source for this address information.\tFor example: GoPlus, SlowMist.\n-Addresses Related to Honeypot\thoneypot_related_address\tWhether this address is related to honeypot tokens or has created scam tokens. \"1\" means true; \"0\" means false.\tAddresses related to honeypots include creators or owners of honeypot tokens.

An empty string (\"\") means the tax is unknown. | (1) Not returned if is_in_dex = 0.&lt;br&gt;(2) When buying a token, a buy tax will cause the actual token value received to be less than the amount paid. An excessive buy tax may lead to heavy losses.&lt;br&gt;(3) A buy_tax of \"1\" (100% buy tax) means all purchase funds go towards the tax (the token effectively cannot be purchased).&lt;br&gt;(4) A token's anti-bot mechanism may set cannot_buy = 1, which will cause buy_tax to also return \"1\".&lt;br&gt;(5) Some tokens are designed not to be sold, indicated by cannot_buy = 1, which will cause buy_tax to also return \"1\". |\n+| Sell Tax | sell_tax | The tax when selling the token. An empty string (\"\") means unknown. | (1) Not returned if is_in_dex = 0.&lt;br&gt;(2) Sell tax causes the actual value received when selling to be less than expected, and too high a sell tax may lead to large losses.&lt;br&gt;(3) sell_tax = \"1\" means sell tax is 100% or the token cannot be sold.&lt;br&gt;(4) Sometimes a token's trading cool-down mechanism (trading_cooldown = 1) can cause sell_tax to return \"1\". |\n+| Transfer Tax | transfer_tax | The tax when transferring the token between non-DEX addresses. An empty string or no return means unknown. | (1) Not returned if is_in_dex = 0.&lt;br&gt;(2) Transfer tax causes the actual value received when transferring to be less than expected; too high a transfer tax may lead to large losses.&lt;br&gt;(3) transfer_tax = \"1\" means transfer tax is 100% or the token cannot be transferred.&lt;br&gt;(4) Sometimes a token's trading cool-down mechanism (trading_cooldown = 1) can cause transfer_tax to return \"1\". |\n+| Cannot be bought | cannot_buy | Describes whether the token can be bought. \"1\" means it cannot be bought; \"0\" means it can be; no return means unknown. | (1) Generally, cannot_buy = \"1\" is found in reward tokens (issued as rewards and cannot be bought directly by users).&lt;br&gt;(2) Sometimes a token's anti-bot mechanism can block our sandbox system, causing buy_tax to show \"1\".&lt;br&gt;(3) When cannot_buy = \"1\", our sandbox system might be blocked, causing buy_tax = \"1\" and sell_tax = \"1\\`. |\n+| Cannot Sell All | cannot_sell_all | Describes whether the contract has a function restricting token holders from selling all their tokens. \"1\" means true; \"0\" means false; no return means unknown. | (1) Not returned if is_in_dex = 0.&lt;br&gt;(2) This feature means that you will not be able to sell all your tokens in a single sale; you may need to leave a certain percentage (e.g. 10%) or a fixed number of tokens (e.g. 10 tokens).&lt;br&gt;(3) When buy_tax = \"1\", this field will not be returned. |\n+| Modifiable Tax | slippage_modifiable | Describes whether the trading tax can be modified by the token contract. \"1\" means true; \"0\" means false; no return means unknown. | (1) Not returned if is_open_source = 0.&lt;br&gt;(2) Sometimes, if is_proxy = 1, there will be no return.&lt;br&gt;(3) If the tax is modifiable, the contract owner can modify the buy or sell tax. This may cause losses, especially since some contracts have unlimited modifiable tax rates which can make the token untradeable.&lt;br&gt;(4) This function generally relies on ownership. If the contract has no owner (or the owner is a black hole address) and the owner cannot be retrieved, this function will likely be disabled. |\n+| Honeypot | is_honeypot | Describes whether the token is a honeypot. \"Honeypot\" means the token may not be sellable due to the contract's functions or malicious code. \"1\" means true; \"0\" means false; no return means unknown. | (1) Not returned if is_open_source = 0.&lt;br&gt;(2) Sometimes, if is_proxy = 1, there will be no return.&lt;br&gt;(3) **High risk, definitely a scam token.** |\n+| Pausable Transfer | transfer_pausable | Describes whether trading can be paused by the token contract. \"1\" means true; \"0\" means false; no return means unknown. | (1) Not returned if is_open_source = 0.&lt;br&gt;(2) Sometimes, if is_proxy = 1, there will be no return.&lt;br&gt;(3) This feature means the contract owner can suspend trading at any time, after which no one will be able to sell (except those with special authority).&lt;br&gt;(4) This function generally relies on ownership. If the contract has no owner (or the owner is a black hole address) and the owner cannot be retrieved, this function will likely be disabled. |\n+| Blacklist | is_blacklisted | Describes whether a blacklist function is included in the contract. If there is a blacklist, some addresses may not be able to trade normally. \"1\" means true; \"0\" means false; no return means unknown. | (1) Not returned if is_open_source = 0.&lt;br&gt;(2) Sometimes, if is_proxy = 1, there will be no return.&lt;br&gt;(3) The contract owner may add any address to the blacklist, and addresses on the blacklist will not be able to trade. Abuse of the blacklist function will lead to great risks.&lt;br&gt;(4) If the contract has no owner (or the owner is a black hole address), the blacklist cannot be updated. However, any existing blacklist entries remain in effect. |\n+| Whitelist | is_whitelisted | Describes whether a whitelist function is included in the contract. If there is a whitelist, some addresses may be allowed special trading conditions. \"1\" means true; \"0\" means false; no return means unknown. | (1) Not returned if is_open_source = 0.&lt;br&gt;(2) Sometimes, if is_proxy = 1, there will be no return.&lt;br&gt;(3) Whitelisting is mostly used to allow specific addresses to make early transactions (often tax-free and not subject to pauses).&lt;br&gt;(4) If the contract has no owner (or the owner is a black hole address), the whitelist cannot be updated. However, existing whitelist entries remain in effect. |\n+| Dex info | dex | Describes DEX information where the token can be traded. | (1) If is_in_dex = 0, an empty array is returned.&lt;br&gt;(2) Only accounts liquidity pools where the token pairs with mainstream tokens.&lt;br&gt;(3) Liquidity values are denominated in USDT.&lt;br&gt;_(Fields in each entry: liquidity_type (e.g., UniV2, UniV3, UniV4), name (pool contract name), liquidity (total USD liquidity), pair (liquidity pool address), pool_manager (for UniV4 pools).)_ |\n+| Anti Whale | is_anti_whale | Describes whether the contract limits the maximum transaction amount or the maximum token position for a single address. \"1\" means true; \"0\" means false; no return means unknown. | (1) Not returned if is_open_source = 0.&lt;br&gt;(2) Sometimes, if is_proxy = 1, there will be no return. |\n+| Modifiable anti whale | anti_whale_modifiable | Describes whether the contract can modify the anti-whale limits (max transaction or position). \"1\" means true; \"0\" means false; no return means unknown. | (1) Not returned if is_open_source = 0.&lt;br&gt;(2) Sometimes, if is_proxy = 1, there will be no return.&lt;br&gt;(3) If the anti-whale value is set to a very small value, all trading would fail. |\n+| Trading with CooldownTime | trading_cooldown | Describes whether the contract has a trading cool-down mechanism that limits the minimum time between two transactions. \"1\" means true; \"0\" means false; no return means unknown. | (1) Not returned if is_open_source = 0.&lt;br&gt;(2) Sometimes, if is_proxy = 1, there will be no return. |\n+| Assigned Address' Slippage is Modifiable | personal_slippage_modifiable | Describes whether the owner can set a different tax rate for each assigned address. \"1\" means true; \"0\" means false; no return means unknown. | (1) Not returned if is_open_source = 0.&lt;br&gt;(2) Sometimes, if is_proxy = 1, there will be no return.&lt;br&gt;(3) The contract owner may set an outrageous tax rate for a specific address to block it from trading.

When the contract is closed-source, other risk items will return null.\nProxy Contract\tis_proxy\tReturns \"1\" if the contract is a proxy contract, \"0\" if the contract is not a proxy contract.\tThis value will not be returned if the proxy status of the contract is unknown.\n(1) Will not be returned if \"is_open_source\" is 0.\n(2) Most proxy contracts are accompanied by implementation contracts which are modifiable, potentially containing significant risk. When the contract is a proxy, other risk items may not be returned.\nMint Function\tis_mintable\tReturns \"1\" if the contract has the ability to mint tokens, \"0\" if the contract does not have the ability to mint tokens.\tThis value will not be returned if the minting ability of the contract is unknown.\n(1) Will not be returned if \"is_open_source\" is 0.\n(2) May not be returned if \"is_proxy\" is 1.\n(3) Mint functions can trigger a massive sell-off, causing the coin price to plummet. It is an extremely risky function for a contract to have.\n(4) This function generally relies on ownership. When the contract does not have an owner (or if the owner is a black hole address) and the owner cannot be retrieved, this function will most likely be disabled.\nOwner Address\towner_address\tThis contract's owner address. No value will be returned if the owner address is unknown. An empty string will be returned if the contract has no owner.\t(1) Will not be returned if \"is_open_source\" is 0.\n(2) May not be returned if \"is_proxy\" is 1.\n(3) Ownership is usually used to adjust the parameters and status of the contract, such as minting, modification of slippage, suspension of trading, setting blacklist, etc. When the contract's owner cannot be retrieved, is a black hole address, or does not have an owner, ownership-related functionality will most likely be disabled.\nTake Back Ownership\tcan_take_back_ownership\tReturns \"1\" if ownership can be reclaimed; \"0\" if it cannot. (No return if data is unknown.)\t(1) Will not be returned if \"is_open_source\" is 0.\n(2) May not be returned if \"is_proxy\" is 1.\n(3) Ownership is usually used to adjust the parameters and status of the contract, such as minting, modification of slippage, suspension of trading, setting blacklist, etc. When the contract's owner cannot be retrieved, is a black hole address, or does not have an owner, ownership-related functionality will most likely be disabled. These risky functions may be able to be reactivated if ownership is reclaimed.\nOwner Can Change Balance\towner_change_balance\tReturns \"1\" if the contract owner can change token holder balances; \"0\" if it cannot. (No return if data is unknown.)\t(1) Will not be returned if \"is_open_source\" is 0.\n(2) May not be returned if \"is_proxy\" is 1.\n(3) Tokens with this feature allow the owner to modify anyone's balance, resulting in a holder's asset being changed (for example, set to 0) or a massive minting and sell-off.\n(4) This function generally relies on ownership. When the contract's owner cannot be retrieved, is a black hole address, or does not have an owner, ownership-related functionality will most likely be disabled.\nWith Hidden Owner\thidden_owner\tReturns \"1\" if the contract has hidden owners; \"0\" if it does not.\tWill not be returned if hidden ownership status is unknown.\n(1) Will not be returned if \"is_open_source\" is 0.\n(2) May not be returned if \"is_proxy\" is 1.\n(3) Hidden ownership is used by developers to maintain ownership ability even after abandoning ownership, and is often an indicator of malicious intent. When a hidden owner exists, it is safe to assume that ownership has not been abandoned.\nSelf-Destruct\tselfdestruct\tReturns \"1\" if the contract can self-destruct; \"0\" if it cannot.\tWill not be returned if self-destruct data is unknown.\n(1) Will not be returned if \"is_open_source\" is 0.\n(2) When the self-destruct function is triggered, the contract will be destroyed, all of its functions will be unavailable, and all related assets will be erased.\nWith External Call\texternal_call\tReturns \"1\" if the contract can call functions in other contracts during the execution of primary methods; \"0\" if it does not.\tWill not be returned if external call capability is unknown.\n(1) Will not be returned if \"is_open_source\" is 0.\n(2) External calls cause the implementation of this contract to be dependent on other external contracts which may or may not be risky.\nGas Abuse\tgas_abuse\tReturns \"1\" if the contract is using user's gas fee to mint other assets. (No return means no evidence of gas abuse.)\tAny interaction with such addresses may result in loss of property.\nResponse Details – Trading Security\nSecurity Item\tParameter\tDescription\tNotice\nIs in DEX\tis_in_dex\tReturns \"1\" if the token can be traded in a decentralized exchange; \"0\" if not.\tOnly returns \"1\" if the token has a liquidity pair with mainstream coins/tokens.\nBuy Tax\tbuy_tax\tReturns the buy tax of the token on a scale from 0 to 1. An empty string (\"\") means the tax is unknown.\t(1) Not returned if is_in_dex = 0.\n(2) When buying a token, a buy tax will cause the actual token value received to be less than the amount paid. An excessive buy tax may lead to heavy losses.\n(3) A buy_tax of \"1\" (100% buy tax) means all purchase funds go towards the tax (the token effectively cannot be purchased).\n(4) A token's anti-bot mechanism may set cannot_buy = 1, which will cause buy_tax to also return \"1\".\n(5) Some tokens are designed not to be sold, indicated by cannot_buy = 1, which will cause buy_tax to also return \"1\".\nSell Tax\tsell_tax\tThe tax when selling the token. An empty string (\"\") means unknown.\t(1) Not returned if is_in_dex = 0.\n(2) Sell tax causes the actual value received when selling to be less than expected, and too high a sell tax may lead to large losses.\n(3) sell_tax = \"1\" means sell tax is 100% or the token cannot be sold.\n(4) Sometimes a token's trading cool-down mechanism (trading_cooldown = 1) can cause sell_tax to return \"1\".\nTransfer Tax\ttransfer_tax\tThe tax when transferring the token between non-DEX addresses. An empty string or no return means unknown.\t(1) Not returned if is_in_dex = 0.\n(2) Transfer tax causes the actual value received when transferring to be less than expected; too high a transfer tax may lead to large losses.\n(3) transfer_tax = \"1\" means transfer tax is 100% or the token cannot be transferred.\n(4) Sometimes a token's trading cool-down mechanism (trading_cooldown = 1) can cause transfer_tax to return \"1\".\nCannot be bought\tcannot_buy\tDescribes whether the token can be bought. \"1\" means it cannot be bought; \"0\" means it can be; no return means unknown.\t(1) Generally, cannot_buy = \"1\" is found in reward tokens (issued as rewards and cannot be bought directly by users).\n(2) Sometimes a token's anti-bot mechanism can block our sandbox system, causing buy_tax to show \"1\".\n(3) When cannot_buy = \"1\", our sandbox system might be blocked, causing buy_tax = \"1\" and sell_tax = \"1`.\nCannot Sell All\tcannot_sell_all\tDescribes whether the contract has a function restricting token holders from selling all their tokens. \"1\" means true; \"0\" means false; no return means unknown.\t(1) Not returned if is_in_dex = 0.\n(2) This feature means that you will not be able to sell all your tokens in a single sale; you may need to leave a certain percentage (e.g. 10%) or a fixed number of tokens (e.g. 10 tokens).\n(3) When buy_tax = \"1\", this field will not be returned.\nModifiable Tax\tslippage_modifiable\tDescribes whether the trading tax can be modified by the token contract. \"1\" means true; \"0\" means false; no return means unknown.\t(1) Not returned if is_open_source = 0.\n(2) Sometimes, if is_proxy = 1, there will be no return.\n(3) If the tax is modifiable, the contract owner can modify the buy or sell tax. This may cause losses, especially since some contracts have unlimited modifiable tax rates which can make the token untradeable.\n(4) This function generally relies on ownership. If the contract has no owner (or the owner is a black hole address) and the owner cannot be retrieved, this function will likely be disabled.\nHoneypot\tis_honeypot\tDescribes whether the token is a honeypot. \"Honeypot\" means the token may not be sellable due to the contract's functions or malicious code. \"1\" means true; \"0\" means false; no return means unknown.\t(1) Not returned if is_open_source = 0.\n(2) Sometimes, if is_proxy = 1, there will be no return.\n(3) High risk, definitely a scam token.\nPausable Transfer\ttransfer_pausable\tDescribes whether trading can be paused by the token contract. \"1\" means true; \"0\" means false; no return means unknown.\t(1) Not returned if is_open_source = 0.\n(2) Sometimes, if is_proxy = 1, there will be no return.\n(3) This feature means the contract owner can suspend trading at any time, after which no one will be able to sell (except those with special authority).\n(4) This function generally relies on ownership. If the contract has no owner (or the owner is a black hole address) and the owner cannot be retrieved, this function will likely be disabled.\nBlacklist\tis_blacklisted\tDescribes whether a blacklist function is included in the contract. If there is a blacklist, some addresses may not be able to trade normally. \"1\" means true; \"0\" means false; no return means unknown.\t(1) Not returned if is_open_source = 0.\n(2) Sometimes, if is_proxy = 1, there will be no return.\n(3) The contract owner may add any address to the blacklist, and addresses on the blacklist will not be able to trade. Abuse of the blacklist function will lead to great risks.\n(4) If the contract has no owner (or the owner is a black hole address), the blacklist cannot be updated. However, any existing blacklist entries remain in effect.\nWhitelist\tis_whitelisted\tDescribes whether a whitelist function is included in the contract. If there is a whitelist, some addresses may be allowed special trading conditions. \"1\" means true; \"0\" means false; no return means unknown.\t(1) Not returned if is_open_source = 0.\n(2) Sometimes, if is_proxy = 1, there will be no return.\n(3) Whitelisting is mostly used to allow specific addresses to make early transactions (often tax-free and not subject to pauses).\n(4) If the contract has no owner (or the owner is a black hole address), the whitelist cannot be updated. However, existing whitelist entries remain in effect.\nDex info\tdex\tDescribes DEX information where the token can be traded.\t(1) If is_in_dex = 0, an empty array is returned.\n(2) Only accounts liquidity pools where the token pairs with mainstream tokens.\n(3) Liquidity values are denominated in USDT.\n(Fields in each entry: liquidity_type (e.g., UniV2, UniV3, UniV4), name (pool contract name), liquidity (total USD liquidity), pair (liquidity pool address), pool_manager (for UniV4 pools).)\nAnti Whale\tis_anti_whale\tDescribes whether the contract limits the maximum transaction amount or the maximum token position for a single address. \"1\" means true; \"0\" means false; no return means unknown.\t(1) Not returned if is_open_source = 0.\n(2) Sometimes, if is_proxy = 1, there will be no return.\nModifiable anti whale\tanti_whale_modifiable\tDescribes whether the contract can modify the anti-whale limits (max transaction or position). \"1\" means true; \"0\" means false; no return means unknown.\t(1) Not returned if is_open_source = 0.\n(2) Sometimes, if is_proxy = 1, there will be no return.\n(3) If the anti-whale value is set to a very small value, all trading would fail.\nTrading with CooldownTime\ttrading_cooldown\tDescribes whether the contract has a trading cool-down mechanism that limits the minimum time between two transactions. \"1\" means true; \"0\" means false; no return means unknown.\t(1) Not returned if is_open_source = 0.\n(2) Sometimes, if is_proxy = 1, there will be no return.\nAssigned Address' Slippage is Modifiable\tpersonal_slippage_modifiable\tDescribes whether the owner can set a different tax rate for each assigned address. \"1\" means true; \"0\" means false; no return means unknown.\t(1) Not returned if is_open_source = 0.\n(2) Sometimes, if is_proxy = 1, there will be no return.\n(3) The contract owner may set an outrageous tax rate for a specific address to block it from trading. Abuse of this function leads to great risks.\n(4) If the contract has no owner (or the owner is a black hole address), this function cannot be used. However, any existing assigned tax rates remain in effect.\nResponse Details – Info Security\nSecurity Item\tParameter\tDescription\tNotice\nToken Name\ttoken_name\tName of the token.\t(No additional details)\nToken Symbol\ttoken_symbol\tSymbol of the token.\t(No additional details)\nToken holder number\tholder_count\tIt describes the number of token holders.
